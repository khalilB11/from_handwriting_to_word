##Problem Statement
During the exam phase, professors face the time-consuming and repetitive task of manually correcting all student exams. This involves two major challenges:

#Handwriting Recognition: Professors often need to invest significant time deciphering diverse and sometimes illegible handwriting styles of students.
#Answer Comparison: Evaluating student responses against reference answers is not only labor-intensive but also prone to inconsistencies due to human error or fatigue.
These challenges reduce the efficiency of the grading process and leave less time for meaningful feedback or other academic responsibilities.

##Proposed Solution
To address this issue, we propose developing an AI-powered tool to assist professors in correcting exams. 
The tool will leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced handwriting recognition technologies to streamline the grading process.
