# Exam Grading Assistant

## Overview

During the exam phase, professors often face the repetitive and time-consuming task of correcting student exams. This process involves two major challenges:

1. **Handwriting Recognition**: Deciphering diverse and sometimes illegible handwriting styles of students.
2. **Answer Comparison**: Comparing student responses with reference answers provided by the professor, which can be labor-intensive and prone to inconsistencies.

To address these challenges, this project aims to develop an AI-powered tool to assist professors in grading exams efficiently and accurately. The tool leverages **handwriting recognition** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to streamline the grading process.

## Features

### 1. Handwriting Recognition
- Automatically converts student handwritten responses into machine-readable text using state-of-the-art handwriting recognition models (e.g., TrOCR, Google Vision AI).
- Fine-tuned on exam-specific datasets for improved accuracy in reading diverse handwriting styles.

### 2. Answer Evaluation
- Compares student answers with reference answers provided by the professor.
- Utilizes LLMs to:
  - Evaluate semantic meaning instead of exact matches.
  - Assign partial credit for partially correct answers.
  - Provide a breakdown of scoring for transparency.

### 3. Personalized Feedback
- Generates detailed, individualized feedback for students based on their answers.
- Highlights areas for improvement and offers suggestions for further learning.

### 4. Grading Analytics
- Offers insights into class performance with a detailed breakdown of common mistakes and trends.
- Provides an overall summary of results for quick assessment.

## Workflow

1. **Input Phase**:
   - Upload scanned handwritten exam papers.
   - Provide reference answers for each question.

2. **Processing Phase**:
   - The handwriting recognition model converts handwritten responses to text.
   - The LLM compares student responses with the reference answers and evaluates their accuracy.

3. **Output Phase**:
   - Generates a grading report for each student.
   - Provides detailed feedback and overall performance metrics.

## Technology Stack

- **Handwriting Recognition**: TrOCR, Google Vision AI, or similar OCR models.
- **Answer Evaluation**: OpenAI GPT, fine-tuned LLMs, or other natural language processing models.
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAPI.
- **Frontend**: React.js or any lightweight web framework (optional).
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure for scalable hosting.
